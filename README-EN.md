## Card Cultivation
### Language
For a better reading experience, we have provided readme files for [Chinese](README.md) and [English](README-EN.md).
### Current release notes
A long time ago, people lived in a world that did not have any high-tech elements, only the most primitive "qi". The wise men of humanity began to think about how to use "qi" to accomplish something. This is their result - cultivation, to make themselves beyond mortals.

As an apprentice who is learning Xi cultivation, you need to break through the dungeon set up by a group of top wise men, and reaching the bottom of the level is the official path of cultivation. For the sake of your future, rush deeper and deeper into the ground!

Just follow the instructions. Please note that the "Store" and "Player Profile" in this version of the interface have not yet been developed, so please look forward to it.

We regret that we are not able to provide an English version of the game interface.
